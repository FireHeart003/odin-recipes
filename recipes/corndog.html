        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>A corn dog is a sausage (usually a hot dog) that has been skewered, coated in a cornmeal batter, and deep-fried. A staple of American cuisine, the street food was likely invented by German immigrants in Texas in the 1920s.</p>
        <p>I love the corn dogs you buy at carnivals but wanted to make them at home so I created this easy batter for frankfurters. Great served with mustard.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup yellow cornmeal</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>2 (16 ounce) packages beef frankfurters</li>
            <li>16 wooden skewers</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; stir in milk and egg to make a batter.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Meanwhile, pat frankfurters dry and insert a skewer into each one. Roll frankfurters in batter until well coated.</li>
            <li>Fry 2 or 3 corn dogs at a time in preheated oil until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.</li>

        </ol>
